# 🧠 Legal AI Assistant & Summarizer 🏛️

This repository contains two powerful AI-based tools designed for legal assistance and judgment summarization:

1. **Legal Chatbot** – A retrieval-based assistant that answers legal questions using Indian law sources.
2. **Legal Summarizer** – A fine-tuned BART model that compresses lengthy legal judgments into concise summaries.
